<p>Snap is a 2 player card game where each player takes their turn drawing a card.  
  When a player draws a cards that has the same symbol (I.e. 2 Queens or 2 Aces) as the previous players card, 
  they have 2 seconds to type 'snap' into the terminal and secure their win.  If, 
  however, they fail to beat the timer, the other player wins.</p>
  <p>Built entirely using Java, the game is ready to play on any java supported IDE.</p>
